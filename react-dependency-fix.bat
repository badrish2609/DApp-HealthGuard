echo   CRITICAL REACT DEPENDENCY FIX
echo ========================================
echo.
echo ✅ MAJOR ISSUE FOUND: Missing React dependency in package.json
echo ✅ VERSION CONFLICTS: React 18 vs react-dom 19 vs react-router-dom 7
echo ✅ ALL FIXED: Synchronized versions and added missing packages
echo.
echo ========================================
echo What was wrong with package.json:
echo ❌ Missing "react": "^18.3.1" (CRITICAL!)
echo ❌ react-dom: "^19.1.0" (too new, incompatible)
echo ❌ react-router-dom: "^7.6.2" (too new, needs React 19)
echo.
echo What's fixed now:
echo ✅ Added "react": "^18.3.1" (ESSENTIAL)
echo ✅ Downgraded react-dom to "^18.3.1" (compatible)  
echo ✅ Downgraded react-router-dom to "^6.28.0" (stable)
echo ✅ Removed --ignore-optional from Dockerfile
echo.
echo ========================================
echo Expected build sequence NOW:
echo 1. Node.js 20-alpine ✅
echo 2. yarn install --frozen-lockfile ✅ (will install React!)
echo 3. yarn build ✅ (React will be found!)
echo 4. nginx production serve ✅
echo 5. Live deployment URL ✅
echo ========================================
echo.
echo The "Can't resolve 'react'" error should be COMPLETELY RESOLVED!
echo Go back to Railway and click "Redeploy" - this should work!
