# ðŸ”§ Fix Branch Name Issue

## The Problem:
- Your local branch: `master`
- GitHub branch: `main` 
- Git can't find `main` locally to push

## âœ… Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Push master to main (Recommended)
```bash
# Push your local master branch to GitHub's main branch
git push origin master:main
```

### Option 2: Rename local branch to main
```bash
# Rename your local branch from master to main
git branch -M main

# Now push normally
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Set upstream and push
```bash
# Set the upstream and push
git push -u origin master:main
```

## ðŸš€ Complete Working Command Sequence:

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Push master to main on GitHub
git push origin master:main

# Or if you prefer to rename local branch:
# git branch -M main
# git push origin main
```

## âœ… After Push Success:

Your Docker files will be in GitHub and you can:
1. Check GitHub: https://github.com/badrish2609/DApp-HealthGuard

3. Get your live link!
