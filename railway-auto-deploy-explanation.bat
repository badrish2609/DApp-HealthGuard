echo   RAILWAY AUTO-DEPLOYMENT EXPLANATION
echo ========================================
echo.
echo What's happening:
echo âœ… Railway is connected to your GitHub repository
echo âœ… Railway automatically deploys on every git push
echo âœ… Your recent commits triggered new Railway builds
echo âœ… This is NORMAL behavior for continuous deployment
echo.
echo ========================================
echo Why Railway keeps deploying:
echo.
echo 1. You have Railway connected to GitHub repo
echo 2. Railway watches the "main" branch
echo 3. Every time you push commits, Railway rebuilds
echo 4. Recent commits:
echo    - GitHub Pages setup
echo    - React dependency fixes  
echo    - Node.js version updates
echo.
echo ========================================
echo Current situation:
echo.
echo ðŸŸ¢ GitHub Pages: https://badrish2609.github.io/DApp-HealthGuard
echo    Status: WORKING âœ…
echo.
echo ðŸŸ¡ Railway: Auto-deploying from recent commits
echo    Status: Building again (because of new commits)
echo.
echo ========================================
echo Options:
echo.
echo OPTION 1: Keep both deployments
echo - GitHub Pages (reliable, free forever)
echo - Railway (might work now with all fixes)
echo - You'll have 2 live URLs!
echo.
echo OPTION 2: Disable Railway auto-deploy
echo - Go to Railway dashboard
echo - Disconnect from GitHub repo
echo - Or pause deployments
echo.
echo OPTION 3: Wait and see
echo - Railway might succeed now with all our fixes
echo - You could have working Railway + GitHub Pages
echo.
echo ========================================
echo Recommendation: KEEP BOTH!
echo - GitHub Pages is your reliable backup âœ…
echo - Railway might work now (worth testing)
echo - Professional developers often have multiple deployment environments
