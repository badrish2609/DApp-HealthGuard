echo   FINDING CORRECT RAILWAY URL
echo ========================================
echo.
echo The Railway deployment is active but we need the correct URL.
echo.
echo To find your correct Railway URL:
echo.
echo 1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
echo 2. Click on your "DApp-HealthGuard" project
echo 3. Look for "Domains" or "Networking" section
echo 4. Copy the exact URL provided by Railway
echo.
echo Common Railway URL formats:
echo - https://[project-name]-production-[hash].up.railway.app
echo - https://web-production-[hash].up.railway.app
echo - https://[service-name]-production-[hash].up.railway.app
echo.
echo ========================================
echo TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
echo.
echo For now, let's update README to show only GitHub Pages
echo which is definitely working:
echo https://badrish2609.github.io/DApp-HealthGuard
echo.
echo Once you find the correct Railway URL, we can add it back!
